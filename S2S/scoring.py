    implementation of fair (adjusted) CRPS based on equation (6) from Leutbecher (2018, QJRMS, https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.3387)
    version with fair=False tested against properscoring implementation crps_ensemble (see https://pypi.org/project/properscoring/)

    INPUT:
        obs: observations as n-dimensional array
        fc: forecast ensemble as (n+1)-dimensional where the extra dimension (axis) carries the ensemble members
        fair: if True returns the fair version of the CRPS accounting for the limited ensemble size (see Leutbecher, 2018)
              if False returns the normal CRPS
        axis: axis of fc array that contains the ensemble members, defaults to 0
    OUTPUT:
        CRPS: n-dimensional array
    TODO:
        implement weights for ensemble member weighting
